      204Viewer is an image viewer with fast high quality resize/rescale
      function, and the ability to store descriptions and tags for images.
      It has an image cache to speed up reviewing collections of images,
      and it supports tagging images, searching tag collections, and also
      writing descriptions or stories about images.<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      <font size="+2">Image Cache</font><br>
      <br>
      204Viewer implements a cache of previously loaded images, to speed
      up backtracking through the list of images. This is good if you need
      to resize large images to fit your screen and you want to walk back
      and forth through the list. <br>
      <br>
      Such a cache is necessarily very memory heavy, so we impose a
      time-to-live (TTL), and a limit on the amount of memory the cache
      can use. Set these in the Settings dialog under the Edit menu. The
      absolute maximum amount of memory that can be allocated in 10% of
      total system RAM. The TTL is not bounded but in practice one would
      generally hit the memory limit first anyway.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <font size="+2">Description</font><font size="+2">s</font><br>
      <br>
      The Description dialog associates a long form description to an
      image. If you have a story about an image or a set of statistics
      &amp; information about it, enter that here. The description are
      stored in a CSV file normally located at
      %USERPROFILE%\Documents\204Viewer\descriptions.txt, though you can
      change the filename and location in the Options dialog in the Story
      manager section.<br>
      <br>

          Tagging<br>
          <br>
      </font>Tagging files is applying descriptive words or phrases to the
      files. The tags should indicate what is in the image, or indicate
      some attribute of the image. So perhaps you have pictures of your
      dog playing catch with a frisbee on a sunny day in the park: tags
      might be <i>dog</i>, <i>frisbee</i>, <i>sunny</i>, <i>park</i>.
      On the other hand you may have pictures of you fishing in a stream
      on a sunny day in a park: tags might be <i>me</i>, <i>fishing</i>,
      <i>sunny</i>, <i>park</i>. Tags are not exclusive, but generally
      the collection of tags applied would be different for different
      kinds of images. You wouldn't tag your fishing images with <i>dog</i>
      if your dog is not there.<br>
      <br>
      204Viewer handles tags with tagsets - lists of tags sorted into
      groups, and also a corresponding list of filename vs tags. A tagset
      is a CSV file, as is the filename to tags list. They are normally
      located in %USERPROFILE%\Documents\204Viewer\tagsets, but you can
      store them anywhere you want using the Tagging Settings dialog box.<br>
      <br>
      204Viewer includes a default tagging file, named generic.csv,
      located in %USERPROFILE%\Documents\204Viewer\tagsets. It probably
      does not contain the tags you want, but luckily you can edit it.<br>
      <br>
      <font size="+1">Tagging a file</font><br>
      <br>
      Select Edit|Tagging to open the Tagging dialog. <br>
      Select one or more files and/or directories.<br>
      Then double click a tag in the Tags list tree control. The tag is
      applied to all selected items.<br>
      Alternately, to apply multiple tags and keep the tag selection,
      check mark multiple tags and click the &gt;&gt; button.<br>
      <br>
      Remove tags by double clicking them in the Applied tags column, or
      selecting them and clicking the "&lt;&lt;" button.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <font size="+1">Adding &amp; removing tags in the Tagset file</font>.<br>
      <br>
      Add new tags and groups either with the Tagging -&gt; Add dialog, or
      using a text editor to edit the CSV file directly. Using a text
      editor is easier to add many tags, but you will need to reload the
      program to see the changes in the Tagging dialog.<br>
      <br>
      <ul>
          <li>
              Using the Add dialog.<br>
              Click the + button to bring up the Edit tag group lists dialog.<br>
              You can add new tag group by entering the group name under New
              tag group... and clicking Add.<br>
              You can add a new tag by selecting a tag group, and then typing
              the tag name under New tag... and then clicking Add.<br>
          </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
          <li>
              Using a text editor. This uses the default tagset file as an
              example. This method is the easiest way to create entire new
              tagset files - just save your tagset under an appropriate name.<br>
              Using Windows File Explorer navigate to
              %USERPROFILE%\Documents\204 ViewerSVS\tagsets.<br>
              Open generic.csv with Notepad or your favorite text editor. You
              should see something like this:<br>
              <br>
              COLOR,blue,red,green<br>
              IMAGE SIZE,tiny,small,medium,large<br>
              IMAGE QUALITY,high,medium,low<br>
              LUMINANCE,bright,dark<br>
              CONTENT,dogs,cats,birds,cars,landscape,city skyline,ocean,river<br>
              <br>
              To add a new tag, perhaps the color grey, just add it to the
              COLOR line:<br>
              <br>
              COLOR,blue,red,green,grey<br>
              IMAGE SIZE,tiny,small,medium,large<br>
              IMAGE QUALITY,high,medium,low<br>
              LUMINANCE,bright,dark<br>
              CONTENT,dogs,cats,birds,cars,landscape,city skyline,ocean,river<br>
              <br>
              <br>
              To add a new group and tag(s) for that group, start on a new
              line, type the group name followed by a comma, followed by a
              comma separated list of tags. Make sure the last line is blank.
              Save the file.<br>
          </li>
      </ul>
      <font size="+1">
          <br>
          Adding tags to files with a text editor.
      </font><br>
      <br>
      Adding tags to files is done with the Tagging dialog, but you can
      also do it using a text editor. Look in
      %USERPROFILE%\Documents\204 Viewer\tagsets again. Find the file named
      generic.csv.filestags. This is where filename vs tags is stored for
      the 'generic' tagset. The format of a filestags file is just:<br>
      <blockquote>
          filename,taggroup:tag,taggroup:tag,taggroup:tag<br>
          <br>
          For example <br>
          <br>
          C:\pictures\plants\001.jpg,TYPE:coffeeplant.jpg,COLOR:green,HEIGHT:not


          very tall<br>
          C:\pictures\plants\001.jpg,TYPE:sunflower.jpg,COLOR:green,COLOR:yellow,HEIGHT:very


          tall<br>
          etc etc etc<br>
      </blockquote>
      So if you have a collection of files you know you want to tag in a
      certain manner, just build a .csv file containing your tag groups
      and tags, and then build a filestags file using your full filenames
      and the tags you want. <br>
      <br>
      This also means that if you have a script that can associate files
      and tags, just have it write out a CSV file matching this format,
      which makes bulk tagging fairly easy.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <font size="+1">Creating new Tagsets and switching Tagsets.</font><br>
      <br>
      To use a new tagset unrelated to generic.csv, use the above
      instructions to create a .csv file containing your groups and tags.
      Optionally create a filestags file if you want to. Save these
      somewhere convenient. <br>
      <br>
      Let's say you saved it as c:\data\plant-tags.csv.<br>
      <br>
      Then in the Tagging dialog, click Settings. Navigate to the
      directory you saved to (C:\data), and enter the name of your new
      tagset (plant-tags) without the ".csv " part, and click OK.
      204Viewer will load your new tagset. This is how you switch between
      existing tagsets as well.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <font size="+2">Search by tags</font>.<br>
      <br>
      Finally, having tagged a collection of files, you can search the
      collection by tags. Again in the Tagging dialog box, check mark some
      tags to search with and click Search. If the tagging data has
      matching files then the main file list will be loaded up with them.
      This can mean a list of files located across multiple directories,
      depending on how you organize your files. For this reason the ".."
      navigation choice is not shown in the file list for a tag search
      result. To get from a tag search result back to the normal file
      system view, just do the normal Right click &gt; Change drive
      operation. <br>
